Ti=Report to the Legal Community in Connection with the MIT Connection Science Workshop on the Future of Law - October 31, 2018

0.Ti=Introduction and Background

0.sec=This report was prepared by students of Brown University in
connection with a Group Independent Study called "The Fusion of Law and Code."

1.Ti=Party Autonomy - Decentralization - Sustainability - Anti-Fragility
 
1.1.Ti="Contract" is Not a "Legal" Function

1.1.1.sec=Putting the legal function in context.  IACCM perspective on the contract function.  The same observation applies in other fields, too.

1.1.2.sec="Happy Path" versus "Unhappy Path."  Legal as error-handling.

1.1.=[G/Z/ol-i/s2]

1.2.Ti=Contract is a General Paradigm for Local Decision-Making

1.2.sec=A decision by the participants that increments their relationship and is effectuated and proved by a record that has at least some elements decided by the participants.

2.Ti=Codification at Internet Speed

2.1.sec=The tools of software collaboration permit legal codification across the spectrum of the law.

2.2.sec=The open source software community has also solved the problem of collaborative economics and governance - incentives, benefit, avoidance of capture.

2.3.sec=The benefits of codification, even partial and imperfect, are enormous, and self-reinforcing.

2.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

3.Ti=Personal Data Stores - The "Database--Client" Privilege

3.sec=Technical advances permit a much better way of handling information generally.  It is particularly relevant for confidential or personal information, and enabling of autonomy and diversity on multiple scales, from nations to individuals.  It appears mandatory for compliance with EU law which is likely to drive world standards as the only serious legal regime for data protection.

4.Ti=Beaten Paths:  Graphs - Deep Learning - Social Physics - the Genius of "Experience" 

4.sec=Experience is the best guide for most decisions.  Massive scale of available experience, problems of "rules." 

5.Ti=The Future of Law:  Law and Governance in the Age of "Code is Law"

5.1.Ti=Legal Clarity

5.2.Ti=Access to Justice

5.3.Ti=Intentional Economy - Sustainability

5.4.Ti=The WALL-e Problem

5.4.1.Ti="When the machines produce everything we need ...."  Hawking.

5.4.2.Ti="When the machines ..." tell us everything we know.  1984.

5.4.3.Ti="When the machines ..." know everything about us.  1984 redux.

5.4.4.Ti="... who owns the machines ..." Hawking.
