Purpose of your course=To radically improve transacting, legal dealings and democratic governance by studying and applying some fundamental principles from open source-software development. To bring together the very disparate strands of a single problem - how to effectively find and transact with others, define relationships and objectives, and resolve disputes.<br>In specific, to explore the "Prose Objects" semantic computing model that is at the intersection of legal codification, smart contracts and distributed data models. This "Prose Object" model will be explored by using and understanding its implementation demonstrated CommonAccord.org. Thus we will explore how to create decentralized, privacy-preserving wikis of automated legal "objects," that can be tailored for every situation. The principle is to specify new cases simply by referencing existing ones and marking only what is different.

The terms smart contracts (code that enables transactions), distributed data models (data stored across several systems), wikis (founded on the principle that anyone can expand any piece), legal "objects" ().
Ted Nelson, Tim Burners-Lee: Semantic
Lessig

John Perry Barlow, with the declaration of cyberspace, imagined that it all ended up distributed. But it all ended up on Facebook. Lessig warns us of this. We currently are standing before a similar precipice, except that it involves law, that is to sat all relationships, encompassing the system of production and governance.
There is still a use for the legal profession: fairness, governance, sustainability (how do the smaller structures have leverage over the larger ones?)

Goals of course={Goal.Sec}

Goal.0.sec=Learning goals:

Goal.1.sec=To be able to critically evaluate the history and meaning of a series of highly controversial terms around the fields of Code, Law, and transacting.

Goal.2.sec=To engineer code solutions that demonstrate the vision of open source transacting and encourage convergence on standards.

Goal.3.sec=To study and design with the core ideas and social physics of law.

Goal.4.sec=To enable and encourage the creation of federated wikis of legal documents.

Goal.=[G/Z/ol-bullet/s4]

Context.sec=This spans a broad range of disciplines, from CS (semantic web, distributed computing, programming languages) to legal (document drafting, dispute resolution, governance) The dilemma of "Code is Law," "Code as Law," and "Codified Law," is fundamental to the shape and governance of society in the information era. What we mean by the shape: social distribution (Hawking: "If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.")

Syllabus.=[G/BrownEdu/GISP-Application/Demo/GISP_Fusion_Law_Code/Week/0.md]

CourseStructure=Each week will consist of the participants preparing for an interview with a specialist, conducting the interview (usually by video-conference), preparing responsive materials that add to the solution and presenting the solution to the expert in a second
conference.

/=Note: made this one big value:

Impact.sec=Law is public.  Legal truth — a description of where you are and what avenues are open — should be available everywhere, on every screen. This sounds impossible, but only because we have become accustomed to opacity.  Map software can show you literally where you are and what traffic is on each avenue.  Law should do the same. You should be able to know how much tax you are likely to owe, if your company is complying with regulations, knowing exactly the deliverables of a purchase agreement-- since law is a formal expression of relations. While law is public, the specifics of each transaction should be totally private.  It might sound hard to combine public law and private data, but that’s because we have become used to blending them together.  In private we often reference public facts and rules. <br> CommonAccord is the product of years of simplification.  Technically, it can be described as “graphs” that render relationships into documents, or a “distributed, agile, semantic web.”  Either way, it’s info that acts the way you think it should.<br>There is a gap between the demonstration materials here and the ideal described above.  This course aims to bridge this gap by defining the model and leveraging open source development (hence the interviewed experts each week). <br> The ultimate goal is trusted repositories of excellent legal text that render into first-class documents.  Eliminating legal opacity.<br> More broadly, because of opacity, systems of transacting absorb a vast amount of human energy and capital. They have tended to favor concentration.  A standards-based approach can radically reduce the friction and reduce the optimal size of "firms" (as upheld by Coase, which we will study).  This can help to improve real productivity and distribute power more widely.  The course additionally aims at studying the important projects working in this direction.  Prose Objects, and the law seem able to unite many of these trends.  The GISP will contribute where it can, study and make recommendations to the University on the impacts of semantic computing. <br> Rather than using technical solutions to replace the legal field, the course explores fundamental principles behind law in order to synthesize how the legal profession can be empowered to solve real issues, highlighted by the readings of Lessig. Allowing lawyers to efficiently design systems, and tailor solutions to people's problems on a cost effective basis.

Attraction.sec=This course will allow us to work on a challenging topic that is directly important today. It will allow students to delve into the subjects of law and code, and think critically about many controversial issues.

CourseGap.sec=There is no course that attempts to bridge computing and the law, nor any that focuses on Prose Objects as a solution.
