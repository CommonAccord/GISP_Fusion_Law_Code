Purpose.2.sec={Contribution.BJ.1.1.sec}

Purpose.1.sec=To radically improve transacting, legal dealings and democratic governance by studying and applying some fundamental principles from open source-software development. The course will teach the history and meaning of legal and software terms, how legal transactions currently happen, and how technology can improve the process.

WAS/Purpose.2.sec=The course will involve a series of interviews with experts in applicable fields, such as consumer protection, personal data store, sustainability, etc., and the interviews will be supplemented with relevant weekly readings around code and law. Students will concurrently develop and apply the already functional model demonstrated by CommonAccord.org, through coding and theory assignments adapted to every level. We will study and bring together the very disparate strands of a single problem - how to effectively find and transact with others, define relationships and objectives, and resolve disputes.

Purpose.3.sec=In specific, we will explore the "Prose Objects" semantic computing model that is at the intersection of legal codification, smart contracts and distributed data models. We will study the impacts and implications of the this model relating to law theory, management and governance. We will understand and define this model to create decentralized, privacy-preserving wikis of automated legal "objects," that can be tailored for every situation. The principle is to specify new cases simply by referencing existing ones and marking only what is different. We will define terms such as smart contracts (code that enables transactions), distributed data models (data stored across several systems), wikis (founded on the principle that anyone can expand any piece), "prose objects" (a way of handling lists to create full texts that permits non-coders to code an structure texts).

Purpose.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

Ted Nelson, Tim Burners-Lee: Semantic
Lessig

John Perry Barlow, with the declaration of cyberspace, imagined that it all ended up distributed. But it all ended up on Facebook. Lessig warns us of this. We currently are standing before a similar precipice, except that it involves law, that is to sat all relationships, encompassing the system of production and governance.
There is still a use for the legal profession: fairness, governance, sustainability (how do the smaller structures have leverage over the larger ones?)

Purchase Agreement: Knowing what a company
Privacy breeches

Guiding questions={Question.sec}

GuidingQuestions.sec=Law, management and governance rely on structured information, expressed as prose. How can you structure information in a way that expresses structured thought? How can you have a system that can both be read easily by humans and is compatible with machines? Should formal legal information still be expressed as prose? Why is this important? What are the impacts of such a system? What parts of social structures does this change? What is the role of lawyers and law in a world without legal opacity? What are the impacts to management and governance?

Goals of course={Goal.sec}

Goal.0.sec=Learning goals:

Goal.1.sec=To be able to critically evaluate the history and meaning of a series of highly controversial terms around the fields of Code, Law, and transacting.

Goal.2.sec=To engineer code solutions that demonstrate the vision of open source transacting and encourage convergence on standards.

Goal.3.sec=To study and design with the core ideas and social physics of law.

Goal.4.sec=To enable and encourage the creation of federated wikis of legal documents.

Goal.=[G/Z/ol-bullet/s4]

Context.sec=This spans a broad range of disciplines, from CS (semantic web, distributed computing, programming languages) to legal (document drafting, dispute resolution, governance) The dilemma of "Code is Law," "Code as Law," and "Codified Law," is fundamental to the shape and governance of society in the information era. What we mean by the shape: social distribution (Hawking: "If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.")

Syllabus.=[G/BrownEdu/GISP-Application/Demo/GISP_Fusion_Law_Code/Week/0.md]

CourseStructure=Each week will consist of the participants preparing for an interview with a specialist, conducting the interview (usually by video-conference), preparing responsive materials that add to the solution and presenting the solution to the expert in a second conference.

/=Note: made this one big value:

Impact.sec=Law is public.  Legal truth — a description of where you are and what avenues are open — should be available everywhere, on every screen. This sounds impossible, but only because we have become accustomed to opacity.  Map software can show you literally where you are and what traffic is on each avenue.  Law should do the same. You should be able to know how much tax you are likely to owe, if your company is complying with regulations, knowing exactly the deliverables of a purchase agreement-- since law is a formal expression of relations. While law is public, the specifics of each transaction should be totally private.  It might sound hard to combine public law and private data, but that’s because we have become used to blending them together.  In private we often reference public facts and rules. <br> CommonAccord is the product of years of simplification.  Technically, it can be described as “graphs” that render relationships into documents, or a “distributed, agile, semantic web.”  Either way, it’s info that acts the way you think it should.<br>There is a gap between the demonstration materials here and the ideal described above.  This course aims to bridge this gap by defining the model and leveraging open source development (hence the interviewed experts each week). <br> The ultimate goal is trusted repositories of excellent legal text that render into first-class documents.  Eliminating legal opacity.<br> More broadly, because of opacity, systems of transacting absorb a vast amount of human energy and capital. They have tended to favor concentration.  A standards-based approach can radically reduce the friction and reduce the optimal size of "firms" (as upheld by Coase, which we will study).  This can help to improve real productivity and distribute power more widely.  The course additionally aims at studying the important projects working in this direction.  Prose Objects, and the law seem able to unite many of these trends.  The GISP will contribute where it can, study and make recommendations to the University on the impacts of semantic computing. <br> Rather than using technical solutions to replace the legal field, the course explores fundamental principles behind law in order to synthesize how the legal profession can be empowered to solve real issues, highlighted by the readings of Lessig. Allowing lawyers to efficiently design systems, and tailor solutions to people's problems on a cost effective basis.

Attraction.sec=This course will allow us to work on a challenging topic that is directly important today. It will allow students to delve into the subjects of law and code, and to think critically about many controversial issues. It is also an opportunity to work with some very smart people and have them think systemically about law. We can work on the issues of what kind of society we want and the role of universities in preparing students for that future.

Theme.=[G/BrownEdu/GISP-Application/Demo/GISP_Fusion_Law_Code/Question/0.md]

CourseGap.sec=Simply put, there is no course at Brown that attempts to bridge computing and the law, which reflects why the course has such a large number of students --particularly upperclassmen-- that want to participate. In the research done to create this course, we have not been able to find any course or even initiative in the world that uses a system similar to the "Prose Object" model. This course can be understood as a survey of the methods and technologies of code and law, as a project to knit them together, or as a kind of inverse of the “coding for lawyers” that some law schools are doing.

EvaluationExplanation={Eval.sec} Note: all written reports will be written using Prose object and git

Eval.0.sec=The Evaluation will be based off of several aspects:

Eval.1.sec=Class Participation: This involves demonstrating thoughtful preparation of readings and other material to be discussed in class. This includes attendance and active class participation. Additionally, during each class, one or several students will be assigned with the task of taking notes and formalizing them.

Eval.2.sec=Midterm: Preparing for the workshops at the MIT forum on October 31st. These involve preparing in the conference (working on the slides, model documents, report), and also particpating in the conference. The MIT Connection Science conference will present to legal leaders the potentials and challenges of frictionless transacting.  This is essentially "Social Physics" as articulated by Professor Pentland, with the Prose Object model as more-or-less the atomic structure.

Eval.3.sec=Labs: Completing a series of introductory labs to become familiar with GIT and the CommonAccord system.

Eval.4.sec=Projects: Each student will prepose a series of projects based off of the material discussed in class that they would like to work on. These can include applying open source-software development and semantic computing to solve problems at the university (Entrepreneurship, Watson Center), improving the user Interface, coding integration with databases to bridge the links (Google Maps, Containers, JSON).

Eval.5.sec=Final: Writing the final paper is a project that begins even on the first day of class. This involves actively participating in the definitions of terms that each student will be given to research and document. It also requires synthesizing the content learned in the other sections. Students will be evaluated based off of their git contributions to the document.

StudentIndividualContribution={Person.CW.Name.First} will lead the section for Interfacing to Existing Systems and Semantic Computing at Brown. Coming from a software engineering and statistics background, she has worked on several computer systems and developed semantics applications. Thus, she is excited to research the possible computing solutions to make the fusion of code and law a reality.<br>Alexi contributed to the application by adding resources and readings to the bibliography and rephrasing some jargon to make the document more accessible. She has interned at the RI State House in the Senate Policy Office and will bring this background to the idea of using computational law to make  state law more efficient and tailored to specific state needs. Thus, she added to the readings and lesson plans of governance sections, specifically week 5, 10 and 14.<br>Kanha provided some suggested readings on the link between version control systems(like git) and law, how the two can be put in connection with each other, and the drawbacks of doing so.<br>Jake worked on a week on governance experiments in the blockchain space. He suggested adding ‘The whole is always smaller than its parts’ – a digital test of Gabriel Tardes’ monads" to the readings on the graph's week, and wanted to talk about Kleros (distributed adjudication) and Aragon initiatives. He suggested the parts on systems engineering and looking at how machine readable documents can allow us to restructure networks, following principles of Game Theory and Mechanism design.<br>Alexandra researched good intros to graph theory and compiled some pre-work for the graph lesson. She will also create the assignments for lesson 5, with separate coding assignments for CS concentrators and non-concentrators. She will help lead and design the lesson on Graphs.<br>Bessie: {Contribution.BJ.1.2.sec}  {Contribution.BJ.2.sec}<br>Drew adds: {Contribution.DT.1.sec}
