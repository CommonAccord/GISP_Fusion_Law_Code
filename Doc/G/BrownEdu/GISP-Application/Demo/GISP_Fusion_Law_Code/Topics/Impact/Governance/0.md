On governance generally, it will be useful to think about how much of current structures are the result of “friction” or “costs", Ronald Coase’s theory of the firm. A friend who worked as an advisor to smaller hospitals said that the many of them were forced to sell to larger chains because of the expense of running IT systems, and once they were absorbed they were shut down and the patients moved to the larger hospital.  Same with many other kinds of business, and with government agencies, too.  Check out Mojaloop (Gates Foundation) - which aims to let anyone run a finance service.

On open source governance, the Linux Foundation and Apache Foundation and others have worked in very contentious areas with lots of conflicting interests, and found a way to iteratively improve, with occasional blowups.  

And then there is the issue of how should open source legal be governed.  https://commonaccord.wordpress.com/center/
