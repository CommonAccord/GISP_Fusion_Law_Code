sec=To what extent can "law" be defined algorithmically?  Legalese, Lexon, Oliver Goodenough, Michael Genesereth, etc.  Do big data methods make this question moot -- all of transacting can be managed as patterns?  As self-driving systems are based on experience, perhaps all of legal can be a matter of identifying paths that usually work well and those that work less well.  Abuses (e.g., bias), inability to provide explanations, the HAL problem.
