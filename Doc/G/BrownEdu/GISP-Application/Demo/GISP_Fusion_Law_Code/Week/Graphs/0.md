LessonPlan.sec=The Prose Object model is a graph, and many applications will be best handled as graphs, likely in graph databases.  We will discuss lessons and exercises in graph databases.

We will delve a little more deeply into systems thinking and engineering and what machine readable legal documents (and the systems they allow us to model) will mean. How would networks as systems with interacting agents, and reward functions be modeled? How can we draw from techniques from Mechanism Design? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design).
We will also talk about experiments in governance that are happening in the blockchain space and introduce the idea of a DAO. Presentation of Aragon and Kleros by Jake.

LessonPlan.00.sec=Integrate the Prose Object model with a graph database.  Demonstrate search functions, and draw conclusions about the extension of the Prose Object vocabulary.
