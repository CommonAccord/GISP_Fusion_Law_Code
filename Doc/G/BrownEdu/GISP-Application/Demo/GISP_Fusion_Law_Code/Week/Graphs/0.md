SubjectTitle=Graphs and Networks

Interviewee.Name.Full=Ethereum Expert (TBD by Alexandra)

Leaders=Alexandra Paul, Jake Martin, {Person.GTH.Name.Full}

LessonPlan.sec=Graphs are one of the most important mathematical concepts used in computer science. This lesson will provide an intro to graph theory. We will explore how the Prose Object model relates to a graph. Many applications of this model will be best handled as graphs, likely in graph databases.  We will discuss lessons and exercises in graph databases. <br> We will also delve a little more deeply into systems thinking and engineering and what machine readable legal documents (and the systems they allow us to model) will mean. How would networks as systems with interacting agents, and reward functions be modeled? How can we draw from techniques from Mechanism Design?<br>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). <br> We will also talk about experiments in governance that are happening in the blockchain space and introduce the idea of a DAO. Presentation of Aragon and Kleros by Jake.

LessonPlan.00.sec=Integrate the Prose Object model with a graph database.  Demonstrate search functions, and draw conclusions about the extension of the Prose Object vocabulary.
