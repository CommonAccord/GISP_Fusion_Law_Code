Ti=Decentralize

0.sec=Decentralizing data is critical for data security, and for economic and political automony. There is a body of work around personal data stores (PDSs), and distributed access control (e.g., @UMAWG).  Prose Objects permit systematic separation of specific information from general information, recursively.  They also provide a strong incentive for adoption - legal clarification, well-organized data.   Blockchains promise "decentralization" but the promise is mostly false - the data is centralized and widely replicated.

1.sec=Consider the many systems of decentralized data (git, IPFS, Interledger, CouchDB, etc.).

2.sec=Consider a federated model where trusted intermediaries (e.g. banks and e-merchants) serve as hosts.  As long as the data model is standards-based, portability will assure competition among hosts, largely preventing capture and rent-extracting. This is similar to email, where email hosts have little leverage.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - effective May 2018) and EU Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2, effective January 2018) provide legal compulsion.
