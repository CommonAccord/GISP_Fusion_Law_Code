Ti=Prose Object Formalization

0.sec=Formalization and generalization of the object model.

1.0.sec=A formal expression of the object model, submission to a standards-setting organization (Kantara Initiative?).  Compatible in plain text (current), JSON, XML, databases, graph databases, IPLD(?), etc. 

1.1.sec=Glossary of terms - e.g., tree, map, key, value, variable, version.

1.2.sec=A grammar of how these primitives are composed to realize more complex graph structures.

1.3.sec=Expressions in various platforms, such as git flat files, JSON, XML, databases ("punctuations" per @xmlgrrl).

2.0.sec=In what ways should the functions of the "Prose Object" format be extended?

2.1.sec=Applying the inheritance model to maps (not merely to keys) and dealing with relative references in maps.

2.2.sec="Smart trees" - objects that pretend to be trees but actually return maps based on algorithms (e.g. to deal with the /G/Z/*, but also more, this approaches "legal algorithms").
