Title of your GISP=Semantic Computing for the Arts and Sciences

GISP.Semester=Fall

GISP.Year=2018

IncludeTheTable=List of participants!!!

Purpose of your course=To study and participate in the development of an open source platform for semantic computing and a system of federated legal codes for contracts and other legal domains based on "Prose Objects" that is compatible with smart contracts, distributed access systems and blockchains.

Guiding questions={Question.Sec}

Question.=[G/BrownEdu/GISP-Application/Demo/SemanticComputing-2018-Fall/Question/0.md]

Goals of course=To bring together the very disparate strands of a single problem - how to effectively find and transact with others, define relationships and objectives and resolve disputes.

ScholarlyContext=This spans an extremely broad range of disciplines, from CS (semantic web, distributed computing, programming languages) to legal (document drafting, dispute resolution, governance)

TopicsWeeklySchedule=

CourseStructure=Each week will consist of the participants preparing for an interview with a specialist, conducting the interview (usually by video-conference), preparing responsive materials that add to the solution and presenting the solution to the expert in a second conference.

Impact=Systems of transacting absorb a vast amount of human energy and capital, and have tended to favor concentration.  A standards-based approach can radically reduce the friction and reduce the optimal size of "firms" (Coase).  This can help to improve real productivity and distribute power more widely.  There are currently important projects working in this direction.  Prose Objects, and the law seem able to unite many of these trends.  The GISP will contribute where it can, study and make recommendations to the University on the impacts of semantic computing.

Attraction=

CourseGap=There is no course that attempts to bridge computing and the law, nor any that focuses on Prose Objects as a solution.
