Purpose of your course=To radically improve transacting, legal dealings and democratic governance by studying and applying some fundamental principles from open source-software development. In specific, to explore the "Prose Objects" model and its interactions with legal codification efforts, smart contracts, distributed data models. We will explore how to create decentralized, privacy-preserving wikis precisely tailored for every situation. The principle is to specify new cases simply by referencing existing ones and marking only what is different.

Goals of course=To bring together the very disparate strands of a single problem - how to effectively find and transact with others, define relationships and objectives and resolve disputes.

ScholarlyContext=This spans an extremely broad range of disciplines, from CS (semantic web, distributed computing, programming languages) to legal (document drafting, dispute resolution, governance)

Syllabus.14.=[G/BrownEdu/GISP-Application/Demo/SemanticComputing-2018-Fall/Week/Blank/0.md]

CourseStructure=Each week will consist of the participants preparing for an interview with a specialist, conducting the interview (usually by video-conference), preparing responsive materials that add to the solution and presenting the solution to the expert in a second conference.

Impact=Systems of transacting absorb a vast amount of human energy and capital, and have tended to favor concentration.  A standards-based approach can radically reduce the friction and reduce the optimal size of "firms" (Coase).  This can help to improve real productivity and distribute power more widely.  There are currently important projects working in this direction.  Prose Objects, and the law seem able to unite many of these trends.  The GISP will contribute where it can, study and make recommendations to the University on the impacts of semantic computing.

Attraction=

CourseGap=There is no course that attempts to bridge computing and the law, nor any that focuses on Prose Objects as a solution.
