Dear scholar,

This is an opportunity to make your own course. Specifically, independent studies are an academically rigorous way to learn about specific interests otherwise not offered at Brown. This is a unique chance to pursue your passions, work closely with interesting people, and create something of your own.

This application form is for Group Independent Study Projects (GISP), Independent Study Projects (ISP), and Academic Internships (AI). In total the application takes about 10 to 12 hours to complete. The deadline for proposed spring courses is the second Friday of November, and the second Friday of April for fall courses.

There are six sections in this application. Each section has a short breakdown in blue text and example text in italicized font. Please delete the italicized parts as you go, but leave in the blue text. The blue text text will be helpful as you re-edit your document, and helpful to us when we give you feedback later.


0.0.sec=Before you begin, the following is mandatory:

0.1.sec=Schedule an appointment with an Independent Study coordinator at the CRC. Come with an idea or a very basic outline of your course. This will boost your chances of creating a successful application.
To schedule an appointment email independent_study@brown.edu.
Applications without a coordinator meeting will not be considered.

0.2.sec=Read the Independent Study FAQs found here.

Submission Instructions
Please send your application as a Word Document to independent_study@brown.edu. Title your document Title_Semester/Year. For example, TransgenderStudies_Fall2017. Your submission should include a) your application, including the faculty statement, and b) supplemental material, if needed.

Good luck! And may the independent study force be with you.
And as always, please reach out (email above) with any questions.

With care,
Your GISP Coordinators & CRC Director
(revised Fall 2017)
