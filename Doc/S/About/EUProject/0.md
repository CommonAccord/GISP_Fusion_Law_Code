0.sec=The scope of the project could be something like "{Project.Title}".  Deliverables would include: 

1.sec=a rendering engine based on Cmacc inheritance;

2.sec=an interface for casual use on phone or laptop;

3.sec=interface for power-user, perhaps a "mode" for a standard IDE; git workflow, etc.; 

4.sec=access management (the most technical and challenging part of the deliverables);

5.sec=tools for the individual to have most of their materials securely hosted, and "carry" only a small amount on their device;

6.sec="graph" database application for managing large stores of Cmacc materials.  (Conversion from and to the file format, search, access control.)

7.0.sec=sample of:

7.1.sec=transactions where the transaction has a flow like the steps of clearing a check - e.g. is validated by hosts of each of party;

7.2.sec=examples of privacy-preserving requests managed by the host;

7.3.sec=documents for doing EU projects (like this).

7.=[Z/ol/s3]

8.sec=GDPR- and PSD2- compliant set of documents for transfers - with multi-lingual equivalences in {Partners.#} languages. 

00.sec=The parties' data could be hosted by anyone (including the parties).  A working hypothetical is hosting by a bank.
