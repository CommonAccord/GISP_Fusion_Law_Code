Rules for Drafting Clear Contracts:

Have a compact statement of the transaction mechanics.  It should be possible to understand the intentions and model of the contract in a short read. This is not merely efficient for the reader, it promotes thinking about the whole of the agreement and relationship.

List parameters:  if there are dates, prices, times, places, specifications, options, put them together.  They can be defined and then the definitions used in the document.  This promotes clarity for the reader.

Use definitions for blocks of thought.  Work hard to make the defined word (the key) convey the meaning of the definitions (the value).
These can be building blocks, promote reuse and standardization.  "Parameters" are a form of definition, but it will convenient to list them separately.  Definitions should be understood as foundational, not variable.

Headings.  Use lots of them. Whitespace isn't expensive.
