Ti=Packages ("Cmacclets")

0.sec=A set of files organized as Doc/; File/; query/; and vendor/.  

1.sec=Doc/ has Cmacc text.  (Should the folder be called "Record/" or "Cmacc/" ?)

2.sec=File/ can have "data" of any nature.  The goal is to be able to communicate a data package - for instance an a/v work or a medical scan - with accompanying text and functions.

3.sec=query/ and vendor/ are technical (suggested by lower-case).  ("query/" is a better label for what is currently called "view" in the existing implementations.  "vendor/" is used for code - and some hosting systems currently require that name.
