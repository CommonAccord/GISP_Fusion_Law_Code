0.sec=The rendering engine should work with a variety of formats:
 
1.sec=The current flat file, source-code resembling.  This enables use with tools of software collaboration.  (Legal source prose is like software source code.)

2.sec=JSON, for instance in blockchains, IPFS, etc.

3.sec=XML

4.sec=Databases - SQL and graph - for enterprise management.

5.sec=Google Docs - and why not have a mode that disrenders the text (makes into key=values) and then rerenders it with possible overrides.
