Ti=Future Possible Extensions

2.Ti=Rendering

2.0.sec=The following seem necessary extensions to rendering:

2.1.sec=There needs to be a naming convention for the _second, and _third_, etc. highest priority Key in the Record's namespace.  Foo=This value used to say: {Foo//-1}.

2.2.sec=The namespace (path) of Records can be augmented by specifying another, additional path.  This additional Path2 adds to the namespace of the Path in the same way that referencing a Record2 adds to the namespace of a Record.  The Path2 is treated as having higher priority than the basic Path.

2.3.0.sec=It is desired to keep the functions and syntax very simple.  The functions that remain somewhat cumbersome include: 

2.3.1.sec=Automatic numbering of cross-references.  These can be parameterized, but there is still a bit of work.  (Can be handled via interface.)

2.3.2.sec=Calculation of values such as sums of a column of numbers.  Can be handled by interface, or by smart contract.  

2.3.00.sec=In each case, persisting the value as a standard Key/Value in a Record may increase certainty by keeping the data simple.
