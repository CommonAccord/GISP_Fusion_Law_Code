Ti=Smart Folders

0.sec=A very useful extension would be "smart" Folders.

1.sec=For example, to replace the mass of Records currently at Z/ol/*, a smart folder could intercept the request for a file and return a (calculated) Record.

2.sec=Of course, smart Folders would respect the object model.  An actual Record would have precedence over a calculated one.
