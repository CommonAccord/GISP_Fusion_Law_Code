Ti=Queries

1.0.sec=A CommonAccord "document" is a report from a database (conventional, blockchain, file system, graph), where the "query" is special.  The query asks for a rendering engine to be applied.  The rendering engine is parameterized with a number of different possibilities.  These are some useful parameterizations of the rendering engine:

1.1.sec="xray" view with each value wrapped with metadata relating to its source file and key name.  Enough info to permit interface to allow pop-up editing.

1.2.sec="doc" view with each Value wrapped in its key, but not the file name.  Like the current Doc view.  Does not reveal the file structure of the generating party. 

1.3.sec="print" view without wrapping.

1.4.sec="used" list of key/values actually used in rendering the document, so can provide to another party in "source" form without disclosing the internal organization.

1.5.sec="missing" list of keys not found.

2.0.sec=All the other "views" currently in the CommonAccord app are common database queries, where an interface has been applied to the return. For example:  

2.1.sec="edit" view of the raw text in editable mode

2.2.sec="raw" mode the text, no editing

2.3.sec="map"(?) (currently called Source) view of the text of the Record with nice presentation, and file names linked for navigation.

2.4.sec="find"  a (partial) listing of keys and values available.  Could be part of graph navigation via "map."
